# 📅 InstaBook

## 💡 Inspiration
We wanted to make an efficient way for people to easily book their schedules. We modeled our site after Texas A&M tours.

## 🔧 How we built it
We built this using Nodejs, Expressjs, HTML, the bootstrap library, and CSS

## ⛰️ Challenges we ran into
JSON formatting was very tricky, but we were able to fix these issues after a lot of work.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We all had no idea how to code javascript, HTML, or css, so we learned everything from scratch.

## 🎓 What we learned
Teamwork, Javascript, and how ugly JSON manipulation can be

## 🔮 What's next for Instabook
We plan on using this site for the MSC Hospitality Organization
